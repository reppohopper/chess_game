## TL;DR [Just try it out](https://chess-game-gules.vercel.app/)
You are both white and black. 

## Scope : It's not the Apple chess app -- it won't play against you
* A basic interface made in PIXI js in which complete games can be played. [Try it out]! (https://chess-game-gules.vercel.app/)
* Correctly lists all possible legal moves for any board state
* Also correctly handles all check states, and obscure accumulating states like [en pessant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant), [threefold repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefold_repetition), and the [50-move draw rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty-move_rule)
* It's bad at announcing game state like check and checkmate. Open the console logs to see what's going on.
