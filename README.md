## Scope : It's not the apple chess app -- it won't play against you
* A [basic GUI](https://chess-game-gules.vercel.app/) in which complete games can be played. 
* Correctly lists all possible legal moves for any board state
* Also correctly handles all check states, and obscure accumulating states like [en pessant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_passant), [threefold repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threefold_repetition), and the [50-move draw rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifty-move_rule)
